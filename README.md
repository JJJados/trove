# trove

I wanted to be able to close Chrome, and reopen my tab groups easily without opening _every single tab_. So I decided to try building a simple Chrome extension to do this. It's worked well for my use-case and is available on the [Chrome store]([url](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/trove/nhnlagbhhimncnmaecadhnkmhnidehaa)https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/trove/nhnlagbhhimncnmaecadhnkmhnidehaa).

Granted, Chrome has since come out with their out native implementation of this, quite the timing I must say. ðŸ˜† So I don't imagine there's a need for this extension anymore! Still a fun learning experience.
